# Bukets NBA Trivia Game - Complete Architecture Overview

## Game Concept
**Bukets** is a daily NBA trivia quiz game where users identify the top 6 players for specific NBA statistics. It's designed as a daily challenge with leaderboards and streak tracking.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Quiz Structure
- **30 different quizzes** that rotate daily based on a start date (2025-10-02)
- Each quiz asks users to identify the **top 6 players** for a specific NBA statistic
- **2 minutes 40 seconds total time** (160 seconds)
- **24 seconds per player** with auto-reveal if time runs out
- **2 hints maximum** per quiz (each hint costs -1 point)

### Scoring System
- **Base points**: 3 points per correct answer
- **Speed bonuses**:
  - 0-10 seconds: +2 bonus (5 total points) - Golden
  - 10-15 seconds: +1 bonus (4 total points) - Orange  
  - 15+ seconds: +0 bonus (3 total points) - Green
- **Hint penalty**: -1 point per hint used
- **Maximum possible score**: 30 points (6 correct Ã— 5 points each)

### User Authentication Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Game scores are ONLY saved for logged-in users
- Guest users can play but their scores are not persisted
- Authentication is handled via Supabase Auth
- User profiles include country codes for leaderboard filtering

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling and development
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** for styling and components
- **React Router** for navigation
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching and caching
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with virtual keyboard support

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)
- **Vercel** for hosting and serverless API functions
- **Real-time session management** for quiz progress persistence

### Key Components
